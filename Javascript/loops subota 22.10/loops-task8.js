//9. Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two
//exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print &quot;Fizz&quot; instead of the number, and for numbers
//divisible by 5 (and not 3), print &quot;Buzz&quot; instead. When you have that working, modify your
//program to print &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;, for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print
//&quot;Fizz&quot; or &quot;Buzz&quot; for numbers divisible by only one of those).

for (i = 1; i <= 100; i++){
    if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0)
    console.log('FizzBuzz');
    else if (i % 3 == 0)
      console.log('Fizz');
    else if (i % 5 == 0)
      console.log('Buzz');
    else console.log(i)
